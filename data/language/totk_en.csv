animals,Creatures,GameRomHorse,Horse,"These can most often be found on plains. Their usefulness as transportation has made them valuable since ancient times. That said, wild horses do tend to get spooked and run off when approached, so if you're looking to snag one, it's best to sneak up on it."
animals,Creatures,GameRomHorse00L,Giant Horse,"This giant horse is the last of its kind. Its physical capabilities completely overshadow those of regular horses, but its temperament is extremely wild. Only a truly skilled rider can train, or even catch, this beast of a mount. This is a horse that chooses its rider."

There are many travelers and researchers keen to seek out this extraordinary creature."
animals,Creatures,GameRomHorseGold,Golden Horse,"An extremely rare horse with a golden coat, said to appear only once every hundred years.

Few riders could ever hope to tame this horse."
animals,Creatures,GameRomHorseBone,Stalhorse,"A skeletal horse often ridden by monsters. These animals, which used to be ordinary horses, are said to be revived in areas where there is a high gloom concentration. They can only maintain their forms in darkness, and they have the remarkable ability to run atop gloom."
animals,Creatures,GameRomHorse00S,Donkey,"Smaller than horses, these are raised as livestock in the countryside, so they don't exist in the wild. They're more powerful than they look and specialize in transporting baggage. This has made them popular with traveling merchants."
animals,Creatures,Animal_Sunazarashi_A,Sand Seal,"These seals use their large flippers to move through the sand as if swimming. They were once wild animals but have since been domesticated by the Gerudo. They rely on their excellent hearing to find their way while submerged in the sand. Their large, distinct tusks look pretty ferocious, but their favorite food is actually fruit."
animals,Creatures,Animal_SunazarashiSP_C,Patricia,"This is Riju's own sand seal. It may look intense, but she dotes on it regularly; the ribbon it wears was a gift from her, and it even has its own pen in Gerudo Town. It's far more agile than any other sand seal and far more outgoing. An ever-reliable partner to Riju, Patricia is always ready to take off through the desert at a moment's notice."

animals,Creatures,Animal_Deer_A,Mountain Buck,"These male deer are usually found deep in the forest. They're well known for their huge, branching antlers, which they'll swing in self-defense if threatened.

animals,Creatures,Animal_Doe_A,Mountain Doe,"These female deer are often found alongside a male. They're very timid animals by nature, but they tend to let their guard down when eating apples, a favorite food. This tidbit of information can be useful to hunters."
animals,Creatures,Animal_Bull_A,Water Buffalo,"These wild cows come equipped with big, strong horns. They live off grass that grows near the waterfront. Their meat is considered to be high quality, so they're a common target among hunters. Fun fact: the domesticated Hateno cow, often raised in villages, was bred through selective breeding using these."
animals,Creatures,Animal_Cow_A,Hateno Cow,"Originating in Hateno Village, these cows are kept as livestock primarily for their milk. Their horns are smaller than a water buffalo's, and they're much more docile and therefore easier to raise. Their horns are decorated with bright colors when taken out to pasture."
animals,Creatures,Animal_Sheep_A,Highland Sheep,"Originally native to the mountainous regions, these sheep were domesticated for their wool and have since found a home in villages. Once the fluffy wool grows out, it's harvested and used to make clothing and bedding. They're calm, timid creatures and move about in small herds."
animals,Creatures,Animal_Fox_A,Grassland Fox,"This breed of fox is common to grasslands and forests and is hallmarked by its fluffy, white-tipped tail. Unlike other foxes, they tend to act independently rather than form packs. Being omnivores, they hunt animals smaller than themselves and often stick to eating fruit and insects."
animals,Creatures,Animal_Fox_B,Snowcoat Fox,"This particular breed of grassland fox makes its home in cold climates such as the Tabantha region. Its fur turned white as a means of adapting to snowy weather, serving as a natural camouflage. Because of this, spotting one in the snow takes a keen eye."
animals,Creatures,Animal_Wolf_A,Maraudo Wolf,"These wolves are not only carnivorous but can also be downright fierce. They're highly aggressive and aren't afraid to attack people. They hunt in groups and surround their prey as a means of bringing it down. That said, if one of their own is injured, the rest are wise enough to run away. They communicate via howls, so if you're wandering the forest and hear their call, you had best take care."
animals,Creatures,Animal_Wolf_B,Wasteland Coyote,"This contentious beast is native to the Gerudo region. It makes its home in the desert, so it doesn't have a problem with hot, arid climates.

animals,Creatures,Animal_Wolf_C,Cold-Footed Wolf,"This breed of maraudo wolf lives in snowy, mountainous areas, such as the Hebra Mountains. They travel in packs similar to their maraudo relatives but are considerably tougher thanks to having adapted to their harsh environment. They're made even more dangerous by their white fur, which provides a natural camouflage in the snow."
animals,Creatures,Animal_Elk_A,Tabantha Moose,"The largest breed of deer in Hyrule, this mammal's origin was traced back to the Tabantha region.

animals,Creatures,Animal_Bear_A,Honeyvore Bear,"This king among animals is dangerous game for even the most seasoned hunters. They'll attack anyone who wanders into their territory regardless of the wanderer's weaponry. As their name implies, they have a natural love of honey. Extreme caution is advised when you spot one, but if you're sneaky enough and maybe just a little bit crazy...you just may be able to ride one."
animals,Creatures,Animal_Bear_B,Grizzlemaw Bear,"This breed of honeyvore bear is distinguished by its gray fur. Even more ferocious than their relatives, they're commonly believed to be the most dangerous wild animal. They live in deep snow away from villages, so it's uncommon to encounter one. That said, if you do find one, you'd be better off not picking a fight with it."
animals,Creatures,Animal_Dog_A,Hylian Retriever,"The native breed of this mammal varies by region, but one thing remains true: this animal has been known as ""man's best friend"" since ancient times. They're very clever and obedient, so aside from serving as pets, they are also put to work watching over grazing livestock. It's said that all Hylian retrievers are descendants of the dog once owned by the king of Hyrule."
animals,Creatures,Animal_RupeeRabbit_A,Blupee,"They may look like mere rabbits at a fleeting glance, but these strange and aptly named creatures glow with a mysterious blue light.

animals,Creatures,Animal_LittleBird_A,Common Sparrow,"As the name suggests, these birds are rather common around Hyrule. They mainly live in plains or forests but sometimes venture out to villages. Their diet consists of nuts and small insects. They look pretty cute when they jump around, but they don't have much love for people."

animals,Creatures,Animal_LittleBird_C,Blue Sparrow,"This breed of sparrow is most often seen in the Lanayru region. They get most of their food from leaves and plants that grow near water. If it's safe enough, they can be spotted bathing in puddles or shallow rivers."
animals,Creatures,Animal_LittleBird_D,Rainbow Sparrow,"These small birds hail from the Faron region. As the name suggests, their feathers are more colorful than other sparrows', which has made them a favorite among dilettantes. They feed on small rain-forest insects, but the omnivore in them loves nuts as well."
animals,Creatures,Animal_LittleBird_E,Sand Sparrow,"This desert-dwelling breed of sparrow has adapted to withstand the heat in the arid climate of the Gerudo region. Sometimes they can be spotted half-buried in the sand, holding perfectly still as a means of evading predators."

animals,Creatures,Animal_Pigeon_A,Wood Pigeon,"These pigeons inhabit vast regions all throughout Hyrule, so they can often be found in forests, grasslands, or even villages. They don't have a very strong sense of awareness, so even less-skilled hunters can nab them pretty easily."
animals,Creatures,Animal_Pigeon_B,Rainbow Pigeon,This breed of pigeon is well known for its vivid feathers. They live mainly in the northern forests and grasslands of Hyrule. They're most fond of nuts and grain but won't pass up the occasional insect or earthworm if offered. Their meat is of a higher quality than a typical wood pigeon's.
animals,Creatures,Animal_Ptarmigan_B,Hotfeather Pigeon,"This rare breed of pigeon lives near Death Mountain. Their fireproof feathers are valuable as clothing material. They usually prefer blazing-hot environments, but lately they've been spotted flying high in the sky where the air is cooler."
animals,Creatures,Animal_Ptarmigan_A,White Pigeon,"This white-feathered breed of pigeon lives in the Hebra region. It's said that a wood pigeon survived atop a snowy mountain by changing its feathers to blend in with the snow and soon after became a white pigeon. They have an extra layer of fat to guard against the cold, so they have been known to yield high-quality meat."
animals,Creatures,Animal_SkyPigeon_A,Accented Pigeon,"The original variety of wood pigeon, these small birds once were seen all around Hyrule but are quite rare these days. Their color often serves as camouflage."
animals,Creatures,Animal_Crow_A,Mountain Crow,"This bird is known for its cleverness and for its distinct claws. They make their homes in mountains, forests, and villages alike. Not only are their jet-black feathers seen as an ill omen, but they'll steal the crops right out of a farmer's hands if given the chance. Because of this, they're often met with enmity."
animals,Creatures,Animal_WildDuck_A,Bright-Chested Duck,"These birds can be found on waterfronts all over Hyrule. Their webbed feet make them excellent swimmers, and their long necks allow them to duck their heads underwater to find food. Their fatty meat is high quality."

animals,Creatures,Animal_Heron_B,Pink Heron,"This breed of heron is characterized by the pink tips of its feathers. Unlike its waterfront-dwelling relative the blue-winged heron, these live in grasslands or arid regions and subsist on insects that live in the grass. They can often be found walking about searching for food but will fly away if they sense danger."
animals,Creatures,Animal_Hawk_A,Islander Hawk,These carnivorous birds live in plains or highlands. They use their sharp talons and beaks to catch and eat small animals and other birds. They soar calmly through the sky and search for prey from above.
animals,Creatures,Animal_Gull_A,Seagull,"These birds live near the ocean. They eat mainly fish, so a flock of seagulls hovering over water is a good indication of where there are fish. Fishermen use this to their advantage when searching for a catch of their own."
animals,Creatures,Animal_SkyGull_A,Cloud Seagull,"This seagull subspecies dwells mostly at high altitudes and is rarely seen on the surface, although one can occasionally be glimpsed through the clouds. They excel at catching updrafts and gliding around the sky, rarely flapping their wings."

They've been dispatched all across Hyrule with a single task: seek out and kill Princess Zelda and Link. They're a crafty bunch, sometimes disguising themselves as simple travelers or villagers to get the jump on you. Be wary of suspicious people you encounter. They're very agile, and their weapons of choice are bows and swords."
enemies,Monsters,Enemy_Assassin_Middle,Yiga Blademaster,"These are the elite soldiers of the Yiga Clan. Equipped with blades of wind-cleaving power, they are extremely agile despite their bulky build. At this Yiga Clan rank, they have mastered a technique that allows them to manipulate the very earth. By striking the ground, they can raise stone pillars and unleash a blast of air."
enemies,Monsters,Enemy_Assassin_Senior,Master Kohga,"The leader of the Yiga Clan, who worship the Demon King. His larger-than-life presence makes him popular and deeply respected. After the Upheaval, Kohga latched on to Zonai devices as a way to increase his power. He had his underlings use the technology to make a variety of bizarre and deadly contraptions to kill you with."
enemies,Monsters,Enemy_Golem_Little,Stone Pebblit,"A very young Stone Talus. Their bodies toughen as they mature, becoming as tough as boulders by adulthood. As a child, however, their bodies are light enough to be lifted and fragile enough to break when thrown."
enemies,Monsters,Enemy_Golem_Little_Fire,Igneo Pebblit,"A very young Igneo Talus. Their bodies toughen as they mature and convert fully into lava by adulthood. As a child, however, while still covered in fire, their bodies are fragile and light enough to be blown away by a bomb's blast."
enemies,Monsters,Enemy_Golem_Little_Ice,Frost Pebblit,"A very young Frost Talus. Their bodies toughen and frost over as they mature, becoming entirely made of ice by adulthood. As a child, however, their bodies are awfully fragile and are light enough to be blown away by a bomb's blast."
enemies,Monsters,Enemy_Golem_Junior,Stone Talus,"This enormous monster is naturally camouflaged as a rock formation. Neither sword nor arrow can pierce its stony form, but a cunning adventurer knows to scale its body and attack the ore sprouting from its peak. Lives not only in meadows and rocky areas but also plains."
enemies,Monsters,Enemy_Golem_Middle,Stone Talus (Luminous),"This enormous monster is naturally camouflaged as a rock formation.

Stronger than your average Stone Talus, and unlike that creature, its ore deposit consists mostly of luminous stone."
enemies,Monsters,Enemy_Golem_Senior,Stone Talus (Rare),"This enormous monster is naturally camouflaged as a rock formation. Neither sword nor arrow can pierce its stony form, but a cunning adventurer knows to scale its body and attack the ore sprouting from its peak.

enemies,Monsters,Enemy_Golem_Fire,Igneo Talus,"This enormous monster is naturally camouflaged as molten rock. Neither sword nor arrow can pierce its fiery form.

A deft hand can steal weapons from the necklaces they wear."
enemies,Monsters,Enemy_Giant_Senior,Black Hinox,"These giant, one-eyed monsters live mostly in the woods and have extremely hard horns.

enemies,Monsters,Enemy_Giant_Bone,Stalnox,"The remains of a Hinox, a giant monster with only one eye. This skeletal beast appears in the dark and can throw its own rib bones at enemies. Furthermore, even if it appears defeated, it will keep coming back for more as long as its eye is left intact."
enemies,Monsters,Enemy_Sandworm,Molduga,"This massive monster swims beneath the desert's sand.

enemies,Monsters,Enemy_PhantomGanon,Phantom Ganon,"Though it may walk on two legs, this creature is undeniably monstrous in appearance. A sinister aura permeates the air around it. You know little of its attributes or behavior, but its strength and weapon mastery make it a formidable foe. It was first sighted after the Upheaval. Its identity and origins are shrouded in mystery."
enemies,Monsters,Enemy_Ganondorf,Demon King Ganondorf,"An evil man who lived long ago in the era of Hyrule's founding.
